    <MESSAGE value="Start of project." />
    <MESSAGE value="Add new target and update build files&#10;&#10;Removed previous cmake-based config files and added new ones reflecting the current state of the project. This update includes a new build target and relates to necessary changes in the cmake build scripts." />
    <MESSAGE value="Base of the project&#10;&#10;Added the project architecture, added libs for GUI SDL2" />
    <MESSAGE value="Implement GameController and enhance game logic&#10;&#10;Added full implementation to GameController, implementing SDL event handling and game control logistics. Additional methods have also been introduced to Game, GameController and Tower classes for handling user input, game and view updates, disk movement, and game resolution. The GameView rendering logic has been improved and some protections against possible divisions by zero have been added." />
    <MESSAGE value="Refactor GameController to handle mouse events&#10;&#10;Rewrote the handleUserInput() function in GameController to handle mouse events, alongside the existing keyboard handling. The update allows the game to accept user inputs for disk selection and moving, enhancing the game logic and interaction. Also introduced GameControllerState to manage the current game state." />
    <MESSAGE value="Implement user interaction features in GameView&#10;&#10;Added new functions in GameView for handling user interactions within the game. This includes processing mouse clicks for tower and disk selection, and creating interactive on-screen buttons for game functions like restart and solve. This enhancement provides a more interactive and user-friendly gaming experience. Fixed disk width calculation in calculateDiskRect function. Modified moveDisk method in GameController to return a bool." />
    <MESSAGE value="Enhance user interaction and fix game play issues&#10;&#10;Added functionality in 'Tower' to handle exceptions when invalid disk selection occurs. Moved libraries inclusion from main to disk for smooth interaction. Optimized disk movement by modifying input and validation mechanisms in 'Game'. Improved logging and game initiation in 'main'." />
    <MESSAGE value="Added SDL2_ttf support and improved button rendering&#10;&#10;Included SDL2 and SDL2_ttf libraries in CMakeLists as well as in the GameView source code, enabling font rendering capabilities. The GameView's button rendering and click detection methods have been revised for better visual appeal with text labels. Additionally, redirected stderr to logfile in the main source." />
    <MESSAGE value="Update graphics rendering and game UI functionality&#10;&#10;Enhanced the graphics of the game, using SDL2 and SDL2_ttf libraries to improve rendering capabilities. Redesigned the game buttons for improved usability and added features for re-sizing and color gradients. The commit includes error logging facilitation that redirects the stderr to a log file." />
    <MESSAGE value="Refactor game control and enhance game solving strategy&#10;&#10;The game control flow was adjusted to make the interaction more intuitive, including the simplification of game start and restart processes. The automatic game solve feature was improved to be more efficient, incorporating a recursive solve approach for moving disks between towers in the Tower of Hanoi game. The changes improve the overall user experience during gameplay." />
    <MESSAGE value="Refactor game initialization and add disk functions&#10;&#10;The game's initialization was rewritten to make use of the new setNumberOfDisks function, which also handles tower setup and color configuration for each disk. Other functions were added to provide further control over the game such as getNumberOfMoves, getLargestDiskSize, isGameStarted, getNumberOfDisks. Game control flow was simplified and improved, providing a better gaming experience." />
    <MESSAGE value="Add SDL2_image library and minor refactoring of main.cpp&#10;&#10;The SDL2_image library was added to the project in the CMakeLists.txt file, allowing future image handling in the game. In a separate, minor change, the &quot;render game&quot; comment in main.cpp was moved to a more appropriate location immediately above the view.render() function." />
    <MESSAGE value="Your suggested commit message doesn't match the explained diff. Here is a correct version:&#10;&#10;Commit message:&#10;Updated several methods and added new functionality to Game class&#10;&#10;The `getTop` method in `Tower` class was updated to be a constant method. The `getLargestDiskSize` method in `Game` class was revised, now it sets `largestDiskSize` before returning it. Furthermore, two new methods `removeDisk` and `returnDisk` were included in the `Game` class to provide extra game manipulation capabilities." />
    <MESSAGE value="Refactor Tower class and enhance functionality in Game class&#10;&#10;Adjusted the `getTop` method in the `Tower` class to be constant. Modified the `getLargestDiskSize` method in the `Game` class to now set `largestDiskSize` before returning. Introduced additional methods, `removeDisk` and `returnDisk`, to the `Game` class for improved game operations." />
    <MESSAGE value="Refactor GameController to improve disk handling&#10;&#10;Removed GameControllerState enum, replacing it with an isDiskGrabbed flag in GameView. This simplifies the handling of user input, reducing nesting and making the logic easier to follow. Additionally, added methods to remove and return disks to the GameController, increasing modularity and allowing for more flexible game operations." />
    <MESSAGE value="Improve drag-and-drop functionality in GameView&#10;&#10;Enhanced game's drag-and-drop mechanism by introducing 'isDiskGrabbed' flag which simplifies the tracking process. Included the addition of a new 'renderDiskWhenGrabbed' method for rendering the grabbed disk at the current mouse position. This upgrade in code design enhances the game's user interactivity while maintaining simplicity and readability." />
    <MESSAGE value="Restart game before solving in GameController&#10;&#10;Added a call to restart the game in GameController before solving it to ensure a clean start. Also adjusted the predefined colors array in the Game class for better color representation. These changes improve the solvability of the game and the overall visual experience for the user." />
    <MESSAGE value="Simplify GameController and add exit logic&#10;&#10;Eliminated unnecessary attributes and logic from GameController, including isRunning, selectedDisk, and selectedTower. Integrated exit flow logic in GameController. This refactor simplifies the GameController class and its workflow, further enhancing the user's ability to exit the game when needed." />
    <MESSAGE value="Implement game state checking and animation in game logic&#10;&#10;Updated game logic to include checks for game state before allowing certain actions, such as mouse events. An animation function has also been added to visually represent disk movement. The updates improve the game's user experience by preventing incorrect actions from being performed and enhancing visual feedback during gameplay." />
    <MESSAGE value="Refactor README.md and update game features&#10;&#10;The README.md file has been refactored and the game features in it have been updated.
